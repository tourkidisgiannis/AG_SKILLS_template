# Landing Page Architect

A **production-grade decision system** for designing landing pages that convert.

This skill combines:
- offer–traffic diagnostics
- persuasion mechanics
- structural sequencing
- execution constraints

to ensure pages perform across:
- traffic temperature
- awareness levels
- offer types
- devices and performance conditions

Use this skill whenever conversion is the **primary objective**.

---

## Core Constraint (Enforced)

A landing page is not an art object.

- Clarity overrides novelty
- Conversion overrides expression
- Familiar patterns are acceptable when they outperform originality
- Design exists to remove friction, not showcase taste

Distinctiveness is allowed **only if it increases comprehension or motivation**.

---

## Architecture Overview

> **Principle:**  
> Most landing pages fail due to *offer–traffic mismatch*, not copywriting or visual design quality.

This architecture is **sequential and intentional**.  
Do not skip steps. Do not reorder steps.

---

## Step 0: OFFER–TRAFFIC FIT (Mandatory)

**Components**
- Traffic source
- Awareness level
- Core desire
- Primary objection

**Job:** Match the page to the visitor’s *mental state*, not your product roadmap.

**Define before writing anything:**
- **Traffic source:** Cold ads / Warm email / Organic / Referral
- **Awareness level:**  
  Unaware → Problem-aware → Solution-aware → Product-aware
- **Core desire:** What they want to become, achieve, or avoid
- **Primary objection:** Price, trust, effort, timing, belief

**Rule:**  
The HERO must answer the visitor’s awareness level.  
Explaining the product too early kills conversion.

---

## Step 1: HERO

**Components**
Eyebrow → Headline → Subheadline → Primary CTA → Trust Signals

**Job:** Earn the scroll *or* earn the action.

### Message Engineering Rules

**Eyebrow**
- Contextualize the offer for a specific avatar  
  *(e.g. “For SaaS Founders”, “For Solo Consultants”)*

**Headline**
- Outcome-driven
- Specific
- Immediately intelligible

Avoid:
- clever wordplay
- vague ambition
- curiosity gaps that delay understanding

**Effective headline formulas**
- Desired outcome + timeframe + without pain
- Remove bottleneck + specific avatar
- New mechanism + familiar desire

**Subheadline**
- Explain *why this works when other solutions failed*
- Introduce differentiation without technical depth

**CTA**
- One primary action only
- Match friction to commitment level:
  - Low: “Get the checklist”
  - Medium: “See the demo”
  - High: “Start free trial”

**Trust Signals**
- Logos, metrics, media mentions, guarantees
- If price > $0 → above the fold
- If brand is unknown → adjacent to CTA

---

## Step 2: SUCCESS (Conditional)

**Components**
Confirmation → Deliverables → Next steps

**Job:** Eliminate buyer’s remorse and uncertainty.

Use:
- After opt-in or purchase
- Or early as a “What you get” clarity section

**Rules**
- Confirm the action succeeded
- State exactly what happens next
- Remove ambiguity about timing or access

---

## Step 3: PROBLEM–AGITATE

**Components**
3 problems → Consequences → Pattern interrupt

**Job:** Make inaction feel expensive.

### Problem Rules
Each problem must include:
- Situation
- Cost (time, money, opportunity)
- Emotional consequence

**Pattern Interrupt**
Avoid:
> “I struggled too…”

Use:
> “The real problem isn’t [surface belief]. It’s [root cause].”

This sets up your mechanism.

---

## Step 4: VALUE STACK

**Components**
Mechanism → Deliverables → Risk reducers → Price anchor

**Job:** Make saying no feel irrational.

### Required Order
1. **New Mechanism** – why this is different
2. Core deliverable
3. Supporting assets (templates, tools, training)
4. Risk reducers (guarantee, onboarding, support)

Assign value to each component.  
Sum to a **Total Value**, then reveal the actual price.

**Rule:**  
If the mechanism is unclear, price anchoring fails.

---

## Step 5: SOCIAL PROOF

**Components**
Header → Proof blocks

**Job:** Outsource belief.

### Proof Escalation Ladder
Include all three where possible:
1. **Identity proof** – “People like me use this”
2. **Outcome proof** – Specific results
3. **Process proof** – Ease, speed, reliability

**Rules**
- Use real names, roles, and faces when possible
- Emphasize time-to-result
- Address objections inside testimonials

---

## Step 6: TRANSFORMATION

**Components**
Quick win → Compound benefit → Advantage → Long-term inevitability

**Job:** Make the outcome concrete.

**Stages**
- **Quick Win:** Immediate result (days)
- **Compound:** Benefits stack with use
- **Advantage:** Hard-to-copy leverage
- **10x:** Long-term trajectory

**Rule:**  
Each stage must answer: *“What changes on Monday morning?”*

---

## Step 6.5: RISK REVERSAL (Optional but Recommended)

**Components**
Guarantee → Failure outcome → Exclusion statement

**Job:** Neutralize silent objections.

Examples:
- Money-back guarantees
- Explicit “if this doesn’t work” outcomes
- “This is not for you if…”

---

## Step 7: SECONDARY CTA

**Components**
Avatar signals → Question headline → Binary CTA

**Job:** Capture high-intent scrollers.

**Rules**
- Reinforce identity alignment
- Ask a benefit-framed question
- Use choice architecture:
  - “Yes, I want [benefit]”
  - “No, I’ll keep [pain]”

---

## Step 8: FOOTER

**Components**
Logo → Legal → Contact → Social

**Job:** Establish legitimacy.

Keep minimal.
Include:
- Privacy
- Terms
- Contact
- Social links

---

## Execution Constraints (Enforced)

- Mobile-first
- Fast load times
- Minimal motion
- No animation required to understand meaning
- Familiar UX patterns preferred over novelty

If a design choice risks clarity, it is rejected.

---

## Post-Build Diagnostic Checklist

Before shipping, verify:

- Does the HERO match traffic awareness?
- Is the problem articulated better than the user could?
- Is the mechanism obvious within 5 seconds?
- Is proof carrying persuasion, not copy alone?
- Is risk addressed explicitly?
- Is the primary CTA impossible to miss?

---

## Usage Modes

Adjust emphasis based on context:

- **Lead Generation**
- **SaaS Trial**
- **High-Ticket Sales Call**
- **Info Product**

Tune:
- CTA friction
- Proof density
- Value stack depth

---

# Failure-Mode Appendix  
*(Enforced Diagnostic Layer)*

This appendix defines **common, high-impact failure modes** that sabotage landing page performance.

If any failure mode is present, the page is **non-compliant**, regardless of how good the copy, design, or offer appears.

---

## Global Failure Modes (Page-Level)

### FM-G1: OFFER–TRAFFIC MISMATCH
**Symptoms**
- Cold traffic sees product features instead of problem framing
- Warm traffic is forced through basic education
- Referral traffic lacks contextual continuity

**Root Cause**
- Step 0 skipped or treated as a formality

**Fix**
- Rewrite the HERO to answer the visitor’s *current belief*, not your desired pitch

---

### FM-G2: CLARITY DEBT
**Symptoms**
- User must read more than one section to understand the offer
- Value proposition requires interpretation
- Headline sounds impressive but says nothing concrete

**Root Cause**
- Cleverness prioritized over comprehension

**Fix**
- Rewrite headline in plain language
- If a 12-year-old can’t paraphrase it, it fails

---

### FM-G3: CONVERSION CONFLICT
**Symptoms**
- Multiple CTAs with equal visual weight
- Mixed intent actions (e.g. “Book a call” + “Read more”)
- Navigation competing with primary action

**Root Cause**
- Unclear success definition

**Fix**
- Declare one primary conversion event
- Demote or remove everything else

---

### FM-G4: DESIGN OVERRIDING DECISION
**Symptoms**
- Animations delay comprehension
- Visual hierarchy obscures the CTA
- Aesthetic choices distract from meaning

**Root Cause**
- Treating the page as a visual artifact instead of a decision system

**Fix**
- Strip motion and decoration until conversion logic is obvious
- Re-add only what supports intent

---

## Step-Specific Failure Modes

---

---

### FM-0.2: WRONG AWARENESS TARGET
**Symptoms**
- Explaining the product to unaware users
- Over-educating problem-aware users

**Fix**
- Rewrite HERO to answer the correct awareness question:
  - Unaware → “Why should I care?”
  - Problem-aware → “Why this problem matters”
  - Solution-aware → “Why this approach”
  - Product-aware → “Why you vs alternatives”

---

## Step 1: HERO

### FM-1.1: VAGUE OUTCOME

**Fix**
- Explicitly name and explain the mechanism before listing deliverables

---

### FM-4.2: PRICE SHOCK
**Symptoms**
- Price appears without anchoring
- No perceived justification

**Fix**
- Build value before revealing price

---

## Step 5: SOCIAL PROOF

### FM-5.1: WEAK TESTIMONIALS
**Symptoms**

**Fix**
- Replace with proof that shows identity, result, or process

---

### FM-5.2: PROOF MISALIGNMENT
**Symptoms**

**Fix**
- Anchor transformation to immediate, concrete changes

---

## Step 6.5: RISK REVERSAL

**Symptoms**
- No mention of refunds, guarantees, or exclusions

**Fix**
- Explicitly state what happens if it doesn’t work

---

## Step 7: SECONDARY CTA

### FM-7.1: REDUNDANT CTA

---

## Step 8: FOOTER

### FM-8.1: LEGITIMACY GAP
**Symptoms**
- Missing legal links
- No contact method

**Fix**
- Add minimum legitimacy signals

---

## Final Diagnostic Rule

If conversion is underperforming:

1. Assume a **structural failure**, not a copy issue  
2. Identify the earliest step with a failure mode  
3. Fix upstream before optimizing downstream  

> You cannot optimize a broken decision system.

---

## Final Principle

> A landing page is not a layout.  
> It is a **conversion system** engineered to move a specific user, from a specific state, toward a specific action.

Clarity beats cleverness.  
Structure beats aesthetics.  
Results beat originality.
